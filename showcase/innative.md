A native non-web embedding of WebAssembly for Windows/Linux

An AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler for WebAssembly that creates C compatible binaries, either as sandboxed plugins you can dynamically load, or as stand-alone executables that interface directly with the operating system. This allows webassembly modules to participate in C linking and the build process, either statically, dynamically, or with access to the host operating system. The runtime can be installed standalone on a user's machine, or it can be embedded inside your program. It's highly customizable, letting you choose the features, isolation level, and optimization amount you need for your use-case.
