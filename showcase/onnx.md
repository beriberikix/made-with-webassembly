The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open standard for representing machine learning models. ONNX.js is a Javascript library for running ONNX models on browsers and on Node.js. ONNX.js has adopted WebAssembly and WebGL technologies for providing an optimized ONNX model inference runtime for both CPUs and GPUs.
