Extending Envoy with WebAssembly

Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications originally developed by Lyft. Previously, the only way to new capabilities required implementing a new feature in C++ or using Lua. Now filters and other extensions can be developed in any langauge thanks to WebAssembly.
