Executing OPA Rego policies in WebAssembly

![ScreenShot](https://miro.medium.com/max/841/0*CVPbCe8f9ATCIKK3)

The Open Policy Agent (OPA, pronounced “oh-pa”) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA includes a compiler that accepts Rego policies as input and generates an executable Wasm program as output. This Wasm program can be loaded into any standard Wasm runtime and executed when policy decisions are needed.
