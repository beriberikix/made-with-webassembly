A creative software development platform for Rust

Makepad is a creative software development platform built around Rust. We aim to make the creative software development process as fun as possible! To do this we will provide a set of visual design tools that modify your application in real time, as well as a library ecosystem that allows you to write highly performant multimedia applications.
