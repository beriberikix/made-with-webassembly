Web Audio Modules (WAMs) are the equivalent of VST plugins for web browsers. They use WebAssembly by passing audio events from browser Web APIs (such as the Web Audio API and Web Midi API), to a WebAssembly module to process and react to the events. They are primarily focused on porting existing C++ audio code to WebAssembly, so it may be used in the browser using the Web Audio Module interface. This is great, as it shows both the portability of WebAssembly (re-using code across multiple platforms), and the performance aspect (using WebAssembly for heavy proccessing instead of JavaScript).
