Avocode is a collabortive tool, to help share design files, discuss changes, and code websites, mobile apps, & newsletters faster.

Avocode uses WebAssembly, as its rendering engine is written in C++, and compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten. Avocode uses WebAssembly, as they found it to be more predictably performant than JavaScript, and generate smaller bundles sizes compared to JavaScript. This is a great use case for WebAssembly, as it highlights how applications that required to be built natively, due to performance constraints, can now be brought to the web.
